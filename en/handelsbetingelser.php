	<h1>Order</h1>
	<p>        
		To order a film contact Crooked Films. A binding agreement between the buyer and Crooked Films has been entered when Crooked Films has undertaken the project and sent a confirmation of the order. 
	</p>
	
	<h1>Prices</h1>
	<p>      
		The price which is stated on our website is a minimum price covering the idea, script, storyboard, preparations before production, production, postproduction and deliverance of the final film. The customer will be invoiced on the day of ordering. 

Additional costs such as transportation, voice-over, actors, models, stunts, other locational expenses - studio rents etc. - are not included in the minimum price as they differ from project to project. The prices of these extra expenses will be clearly stated on the invoice. 

All prices are stated incl. VAT 
	</p>
	
	<h1>Payment</h1>
	<p>
		The payment is divided into two installments.  The first invoice will be sent together with the order confirmation, and is for half of the minimum price. The second invoice will be sent together with the final film and is for the remainder of the minimum price plus any extra expenses. 

If the invoice is not paid within 8 days  - as stated in the payment conditions - a fee will be imposed for every 10th day overdue according to the current rules.
